                <p>Hello World!My name is Emme Hasanovic. Working on my first website. This is my first website that I have coded myself. I love it and and I am having fun here at SMU. It was hard at first ... it is getting easier as I progress into the more.

                  I have earned Degree in the Fashion Design and I am willing to do Full Stack in programming so I could create one of mine concepts for a global friendship site. website. I have also worked in the Finance Industy for the past 8 years and I have decided to to do career change. I still have a long way to go. So excited with this program.
                        
                <p>I was born in Bosnia, during 1990-1992 I left the country since we had a second largest war in the European continent. I went to Germany with my parents and younger brother we stayed there for 4 years and I later immigrated to USA . Dallas Texas has been my home since 1997. This is where my heart is.. It is a typical Texas day , a four seasons will change in one day.. Love it . GOD bless me and USA.
